我偏爱以步履丈量山海，用笔墨打捞时光。行囊里装着清风与落日，笔记本上记着人间烟火与旅途轶事。偶有闲情，便将沿途的遇见、刹那的心动，凝练成几行随笔；兴之所至，也会把路过的城郭、听过的故事，铺陈成一纸浅墨。不苛求字字珠玑，只愿在文字里，与自己、与同路人，共享片刻的温柔与自在。

I am fond of measuring mountains and seas with my footsteps and salvaging fleeting moments with my words. My bag is filled with fresh breezes and setting suns, and my notebook is inscribed with the trivial warmth of daily life and anecdotes from my journeys. When leisure finds me, I condense the encounters along the way and the sudden stirrings of my heart into a few lines of essays; when inspiration strikes, I also unfold the cities I’ve passed through and the stories I’ve heard into a page of delicate prose. I do not strive for perfection in every word, but only wish to share a moment of tenderness and ease with myself and like-minded souls through these lines.
